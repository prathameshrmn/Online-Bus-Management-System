The Online Bus Management System aims to revolutionize the way bus 

services are operated and accessed by leveraging technological 

advancements, primarily through an ASP.NET-based platform. It caters 

to the needs of various stakeholders within the bus transportation 

ecosystem, including passengers, bus operators, and administrative 

staff.

This system offers an integrated platform that simplifies and centralizes 

the management of bus routes, schedules, ticketing, and passenger 

information. It provides a user-friendly interface for passengers to 

efficiently book tickets, check schedules, and access real-time updates. 

For bus operators and administrative personnel, it offers tools to 

manage fleets, monitor routes, handle reservations, and streamline 

administrative tasks.
